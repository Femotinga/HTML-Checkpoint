            <p>Chief Joseph Olaitan Adenuga Jr.[1] (born 19 September 1982), known professionally as Skepta, is a
                British-Nigerian grime MC, rapper and record producer. Alongside his younger brother Jme, he briefly
                joined Roll Deep before they became founding members of Boy Better Know in 2005.
                With Boy Better Know, Skepta clashed with fellow MC Devilman for the video release Lord of the Mics 2,
                in what is remembered as one of the biggest clashes in grime history.[2][3] Skepta released his debut
                studio album Greatest Hits in 2007 and his second album, Microphone Champion in 2009, both
                independently; while his third studio album Doin' It Again was released in 2011 by AATW. He made his
                acting debut in the 2015 film Anti-Social. Skepta's fourth studio album, Konnichiwa (2016), featured the
                hit singles "That's Not Me" and "Shutdown". The album, which was widely acclaimed, won the Mercury
                Prize.</p>
